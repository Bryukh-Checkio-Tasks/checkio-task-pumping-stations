<p>
    Nicola wants to build a system of pipes connecting all the pumping stations on the island.
    Each pumping station is located in a rectangular field split into squares and occupies a connected set of one or more squares.
    Two occupied squares whose corners touch are considered to be a single station and do not need a pipe.
    Pipes may be built only on the grid lines that form the edges of the squares.
    Each pipe must be built in a straight line and must connect exactly two stations.
    For a given set of stations, you must find the minimum number of pipes needed to connect every station and summarize the length
    of the pipes. If this is impossible, you must find a solution that minimizes the number of non-connected stations.
    Among the possible solutions with the same number of pipes,
    choose the one that minimizes the total length of the pipes (measured in multiples of the grid size.)
    Two pipes may cross, but in this case they are considered to go over or around each other and
    do not provide a connection from one pipe to the other. Pumping stations are represented as a matrix of ones and zeros,
    where 1 is a station, 0 is an empty space.
